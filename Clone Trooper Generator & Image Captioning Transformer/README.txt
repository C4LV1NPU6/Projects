I spent a total of 45 hours on both of these projects (Clone Trooper Generator and Image Captioning Transformer).

Work for both of these projects was split between two of my courses (Artificial Intelligence (CS 470) and Deep Learning (CS 474)).

The time I spent working on each of these projects and in each of these courses is recorded in the hour log sections of the reports (the PDFs).
